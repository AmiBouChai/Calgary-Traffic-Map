Created for a class project, this is a Raspberry Pi Pico program that shows real-time traffic closures in downtown Calgary by lighting up LEDs on a 3D printed map of downtown Calgary.
I was responsible for the software side of the project, while others worked on the CAD design and circuitry. The files that were written by me were main1.py and LEDMatrix.py, all the others were pre-written.
